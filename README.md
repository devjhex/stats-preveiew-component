## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

 What I learned in this project is how to use grid to do advanced stuff concerning layout and it is so amazing because you don't have to worry about margins, paddings and other stuff too much rather you would just carefully create columns or rows to make some space between the elements you want. 


### Continued development

I would like to work on my skills concerning CSS grid that is making so many layouts using grid so as  to be perfect in it because in my opinion it is so valuable to have as a skill most especially in front-end software development.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.kevinpowell.co) - Kevin has been a great help most especially on the part of grid and I know he normally goes really fast but he is a really good teacher who I really recommend if you're an intermediate learner who has the basics of CSS.
